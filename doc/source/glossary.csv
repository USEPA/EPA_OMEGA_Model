No-action Alternative,,,,"Within any given baseline scenario, the decision to adopt no new OTAQ regulatory actions beyond the existing regulations"
Action Alternative,,,,A set of definitions that fully describe the OTAQ regulations under consideration
Historical Fleet,,,,"The vehicles and their attributes that have already been produced in reality, up to and including the base model year"
