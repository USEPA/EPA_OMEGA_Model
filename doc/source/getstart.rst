Getting Started
===================
The OMEGA model is written in the open source Python language.  This allows distribution using multiple methods depending on the type of end user:

*  For users intending to run the OMEGA model and modify inputs only, the executable version is available containing an executable file, directory structure, and a complete set of sample inputs.

*  For users intending to run the OMEGA model and optionally modify code, the developer version is available through interaction with the OMEGA model GitHub repository.  For more information on the developer version, please refer to the :ref:`developer_guide_label`.

Downloading the Executable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The executable version of the OMEGA model is available as a single .zip file  at:

  *  https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/optimization-model-reducing-emissions-greenhouse-gases

Setting up a Run Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a directory that will be used as the main run directory for the OMEGA model and copy the downloaded .zip file into this directory.  Unzip the file into this directory to create the entire OMEGA model file structure.

Running the Executable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The newly created run directory will contain the OMEGA model executable file 'OMEGAXXX.exe'.  Opening this file will bring up the OMEGA graphical user interface.

Step by Step Example Model Run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please refer to the :ref:`graphical_user_interface_label` documentation for a step by step execution of the sample model run.

Viewing the Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After OMEGA model runs have completed, the results can be viewed by using the graphical user interface.

Customizing Runs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
