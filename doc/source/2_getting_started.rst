Getting Started
===================
The OMEGA model is written in the open source Python programming language. The model is available in two different packages to suit the particular requirements of the end user:

*  For users intending to run the OMEGA model with input modifications only, an executable version is available along with a directory structure and a complete set of sample inputs. This Getting Started chapter is focused on this executable version.

*  For users intending to run the OMEGA model with user-definable submodules or other code modifications, a developer version is available in a GitHub repository. For more information on the developer version, please refer to the :ref:`developer_guide_label`.

Downloading OMEGA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Releases of the OMEGA model executables are be available at:

Running OMEGA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opening the executable will bring up the OMEGA graphical user interface.  The executable takes a few moments to start up, (or it may take longer, depending on the speed of the userâ€™s computer), as it contains compressed data which must be extracted to a temporary folder.  A self-contained Python installation is included in the executable and Python does not need to be installed by the user in order to run OMEGA. A console window will also be displayed in addition to the GUI window which shows additional runtime information and any diagnostic messages that may be generated.

The GUI has two file system selection boxes in the ``Run Model`` tab; one for choosing the batch file (e.g. ``test_batch.csv``) and one for choosing the folder where the batch will execute and produce outputs.  The output folder for the batch will contain the model source code, the batch file, a log file, a requirements file describing the Python installation details, and subfolders for each simulation session.  These session folders will contain an ``in`` and an ``out`` folder.  The ``in`` folder contains the complete set of inputs to the session, and the ``out`` folder contains the simulation outputs and log file.

Step by Step Example Model Run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please refer to the :ref:`graphical_user_interface_label` documentation for a step by step execution of an example model run.

Viewing the Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After OMEGA model runs have completed, the results generated for each session are available in the associated ``out`` folder in ``.csv`` and ``.png`` file formats.
