Model Overview
==============
OMEGA is a tool that has been developed by EPA to evaluate policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles. Like prior versions of OMEGA, this latest version is intended primarily as a regulatory support tool that provides estimates of the effects and costs of policy alternatives under consideration. These include the costs associated with emissions-reducing technologies themselves and the items normally included in a societal benefit-cost analysis, as well as physical effects that would be reported in an emissions inventory. Other potential uses for OMEGA may be valuable to stakeholders elsewhere -- including other parts of EPA, other agencies, NGOs, states, academia, and industry. We have attempted to emphasize modularity, transparency, and flexibility so that these stakeholders might design and develop modules that they may design for their own needs. 
  
Fundamentally, OMEGA is structured around modeling the interactions between vehicle producers responding to a policy and consumers who own and use those vehicles. This interaction between decisions by producers and consumers is a central function of the model, and was a topic of particular focus in the development of this latest version. Without this expanded capability it would not be possible to fully model policy alternatives which influence ownership and use patterns through changes in vehicle attributes.

Like any other model, OMEGA relies on the user to specify appropriate inputs and assumptions. Some of these may be provided by direct empirical observations, for example the number of currently registered vehicles. Others might be generated by modeling tools outside of OMEGA, such as physics-based vehicle simulation results produced like the EPA's ALPHA model, or transportation demand forecasts from DOE's NEMS model. OMEGA has adopted data elements and strucutures that are generic, wherever possible, so that inputs can be provided from whichever sources the user deems most appropriate.

Inputs and Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The inputs and assumptions are categorized according to whether they fall inside or outside the policy alternatives under evaluation in a given analysis.

* *Policy Alternative* inputs describe the standards themselves, including the program elements and methodologies for determining compliance as would be defined for an EPA rule in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations.

* *Analysis Context* inputs and assumptions cover the range of factors that the user assumes, for the purpose of analyses, are independent of the policy alternatives. The user may project changes in the context inputs over the analysis timeframe based on other sources, but for a given analysis year the context definition requires that these inputs are common across the policy alternatives being compared. The context inputs may include fuel costs, costs and emissions rates for a particular vehicle technology package, consumer demand parameters, and many more.

The primary outputs are the environmental effects and societal costs and benefits for a given policy alternative and analysis context pair. These outputs are expressed in absolute values, so that incremental effects, costs, and benefits can be evaluated by comparing two policy alternatives (for a given context) or the sensitivity to assumptions for two different analysis contexts (for a given policy alternative.) 

Modularity 
^^^^^^^^^^
OMEGA has been set up so that primary components of the model are clearly delineated in such a way that changing one component of the model will not require code changes throughout the model. Four main modules are defined along the lines of their real-world analogs representing consumers, producers, policy, and effects. a policy in a strictly-defined way and provides users the option of interchanging any of OMEGA’s default modules with their own, while preserving the consistency and functionality of the larger model

OMEGA is structured around two key modules; a Consumer Module and a Producer Module, which each contain a decision-model for the respective entities. The Consumer Module’s purpose is to estimate how vehicle ownership and use respond to key vehicle characteristics within a given analysis context. An important featuer of the Consumer Module is that it allows different endogenous consumer responses to Electric and Internal Combustion Engine vehicles.

Additional functions of OMEGA related to policy assumptions and environmental/economic effects are also designed as modules 

Iteration and Convergence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OMEGA’s Producer and Consumer Modules represent distinct decision making entities, which if treated separately and in isolation would not normally arrive at an equilibrium of vehicles supplied and demanded. The identification of an equilibrium solution in OMEGA requires an interactive relationship between the Consumer and Producer Modules. 

Internal to OMEGA, the two primary modules receive and respond to each other’s outputs, iterating until the demands of consumers converge with the vehicles provided by the producers

Introduction
------------
EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality is constantly looking for ways to improve the analyses performed in support of the regulations put forth. A current effort is focused on updating our ability to model producer and consumer responses to regulations that reduce greenhouse gasses emissions from light duty vehicles in the United States. The thrust of this effort has been focused on creating a new OMEGA model, which updates the useability and capabilities of the first OMEGA model. One major update is the introduction of endogenous consumer choice modeling. This document lays out the inputs, outputs, assumptions and equations that are used in the consumer modeling effort. It does not include documentation for other portions of the OMEGA model. It also does not include documentation of the OMEGA code. For documentation on the OMEGA model as whole, see `OMEGA Documentation <https://omega2.readthedocs.io/>`_ . To explore the OMEGA model code, see `OMEGA GitHub <https://github.com/USEPA/EPA_OMEGA_Model/>`_ .

History of OMEGA
++++++++++++++++
The EPA first created an OMEGA model over ten years ago to estimate producer responses to greenhouse gas emission reducing policies. This model evaluated relative costs and effectiveness of available technology packages, applied them to a defined fleet to meet a specified footprint-based fleet emissions standard. The model generated cost-minimizing compliance pathways for individual manufacturers in five year time steps assuming fleet averaging and unlimited car-truck transfers within each company. A high-level overview of the structure of the original OMEGA model can be seen in :numref:`mo_label1`. The existing stock and footprint-based policy alternatives were fed into the model, producers decided the level and types of vehicles to produce while meetings the requirements, and the societal costs and environmental effects were estimated for the resulting estimated stock.

    Original OMEGA Model Overview

Though the model was used in multiple EPA regulatory analyses between 2010 and 2016, the state of the world has changed dramatically over the years and the model’s assumptions and capabilities have become out of date since it was first created. A major change in the state of the world is an expanded focus beyond the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. Electric vehicle (EV) technology and markets have evolved significantly, and will likely continue to evolve. In addition, there are potential changes in mobility demand and new mobility services, including the use of light duty vehicles (LDVs) for deliver services, shared and autonomous fleets, and the increased focus on micromobility. We are unable to incorporate these changes in the previous OMEGA model. In addition, our model design capabilities and the tools available to us have expanded. Taken together, this has led us to create a new OMEGA model. This new OMEGA model is an open source compliance and effects modeling tool that is transparent, user-friendly, and has the flexibility to evaluate a broad range of transportation policy, technology and market scenarios.

New OMEGA Model
+++++++++++++++
Creating a new OMEGA model has allowed us to improve upon previous efforts in a few ways, including building in pre- and post-processing steps, adding endogenous consumer responses, improving manufacturer decision modeling and adding feedback between consumer and producer decisions. In addition, the model is built to be modular, user friendly, and transparent. Stakeholders will more easily be able to inspect the model and assumptions, as well as revise assumptions and generate results without unusual computing capabilities, extensive training or restrictive licensing. The model itself is available to the public on GitHub.  The model takes context assumptions, existing stock and policy alternatives, iterates on producer choices and consumer responses, and estimates effects, outputting societal costs and environmental effects. A simplistic overview of the updated model is seen in :numref:`mo_label2`, below.
