:OMEGA:
 Optimization Model for reducing Emissions of Greenhouse Gasses from Automobiles
:Nameplate:
 Consumer recognizable name of historical vehicles (e.g. "Cruze"). Also known as 'Model'
:Make:
 Consumer recognizable brand of a historical vehicle (e.g. "Chevrolet"). Also known as 'Brand'
:Manufacturer:
 Company that is treated as a regulated entity (e.g. "General Motors")
:Baseline Scenarios:
 This is also knows as 'BAU' or 'Reference'. The term is too ambiguous without further clarification. See "Policy Alternatives" and "Context Scenarios" instead.
:No-action Alternative:
 Within any given baseline scenario, the decision to adopt no new OTAQ regulatory actions beyond the existing regulations
:Action Alternative:
 A set of definitions that fully describe the OTAQ regulations under consideration
:Historical Fleet:
 The vehicles and their attributes that have already been produced in reality, up to and including the base model year
:Legacy Fleet:
 The set of historical vehicles as they are modeled beyond the base year
:Base Model Year:
 The last model year of the historical fleet
:Stock:
 The number of vehicles and their attributes registered at a given time (Legacy Fleet + Compliance Fleet). Also known as 'On-road Fleet'
:Count:
 The number of vehicles registered at a given time. Also known as 'Population'
:Compliance Fleet:
 The fleet of modeled vehicles with Model Year > Initial Year
:Age:
 Calendar year minus model year (age 0 = MY 2020 vehicles in CY 2020)
:Powertrain Efficiency:
 Ratio of useful work to total fuel energy
:Effectiveness:
 Incremental percentage reduction in CO2 emissions between two packages
:Analysis Context:
 The set of assumptions about the future within which the policies are evaluated. Note that all contexts must be internally consistent. Also known as 'Context'
:Policy Alternatives:
 Encompasses both the No-action Alternative and the Action Alternatives. This is a more generic term than the alternatives. Also known as 'Policy Scenarios'
:Scenario:
 This term is too ambiguous without further clarification - avoid using without clarification
:Modeling Assumptions:
 DEFINITION
:Tech Cost:
 The portion of generalized costs associated with producing the vehicle
:Generalized Cost:
 Sum of monetary and non-monetary costs of the choices considered by the decision maker. - valuation? What is non-monetary for producers?
:Producer Generalized Cost:
 Also referred to as 'PGC'
:Consumer Generalized Cost:
 ALso referred to as 'CGC'
:Price:
 DEFINITION
:Year:
 Calendar year
:Analysis Year:
 Any calendar year for which the model is generating results
:Base Year:
 The last calendar year of the historical input data. Also known as 'Initial Year'
:Initial Analysis Year:
 One year after the initial year. It is the first analysis year
:Sample:
 DEFINITION
:Default:
 DEFINITION
:Context Scenarios:
 The set of Analysis Contexts that encompass a range of possible inputs representing the future (fuel prices, sales, adoption rates, etc.)
:Market Class:
 The categorization of vehicles used for projecting market shares and modeling consumer response to policy through shifts in market shares
:Regulatory Class:
 The categorization of vehicles defined by the Policy Alternative and considered in the producers compliance decisions and not neccesarilly related to market class classification considered by the consumer
