Glossary
--------

Action Alternative:
 A set of definitions that fully describe the OTAQ regulations under consideration
Age:
 Calendar year minus model year (age 0 = MY 2020 vehicles in CY 2020)
Analysis Context:
 The set of assumptions about the future within which the policies are evaluated. Note that all contexts must be internally consistent. Also known as 'Context'
Analysis Year:
 Any calendar year for which the model is generating results
Baseline Scenarios:
 This is also knows as 'BAU' or 'Reference'. The term is too ambiguous without further clarification. See "Policy Alternatives" and "Context Scenarios" instead.
Base Model Year:
 The last model year of the historical fleet
Base Year:
 The last calendar year of the historical input data. Also known as 'Initial Year'
Compliance Fleet:
 The fleet of modeled vehicles with Model Year > Initial Year
Context Scenarios:
 The set of Analysis Contexts that encompass a range of possible inputs representing the future (fuel prices, sales, adoption rates, etc.)
Count:
 The number of vehicles registered at a given time. Also known as 'Population'
Effectiveness:
 Incremental percentage reduction in CO2 emissions between two packages
Generalized Cost:
 Sum of monetary and non-monetary costs of the choices considered by the decision maker. - valuation? What is non-monetary for producers?
Historical Fleet:
 The vehicles and their attributes that have already been produced in reality, up to and including the base model year
Initial Analysis Year:
 One year after the initial year. It is the first analysis year
Legacy Fleet:
 The set of historical vehicles as they are modeled beyond the base year
Make:
 Consumer recognizable brand of a historical vehicle (e.g. "Chevrolet"). Also known as 'Brand'
Manufacturer:
 Company that is treated as a regulated entity (e.g. "General Motors")
Market Class:
 The categorization of vehicles used for projecting market shares and modeling consumer response to policy through shifts in market shares
Nameplate:
 Consumer recognizable name of historical vehicles (e.g. "Cruze"). Also known as 'Model'
No-action Alternative:
 Within any given baseline scenario, the decision to adopt no new OTAQ regulatory actions beyond the existing regulations
OMEGA:
 Optimization Model for reducing Emissions of Greenhouse Gasses from Automobiles
On-Road Gap:
 Difference between direct cert emissions and direct on-road emissions
Policy Alternatives:
 Encompasses both the No-action Alternative and the Action Alternatives. This is a more generic term than the alternatives. Also known as 'Policy Scenarios'
Powertrain Efficiency:
 Ratio of useful work to total fuel energy
Regulatory Class:
 The categorization of vehicles defined by the Policy Alternative and considered in the producers compliance decisions and not neccesarilly related to market class classification considered by the consumer
Scenario:
 This term is too ambiguous without further clarification - avoid using without clarification
Stock:
 The number of vehicles and their attributes registered at a given time (Legacy Fleet + Compliance Fleet). Also known as 'On-road Fleet'
Tech Cost:
 The portion of generalized costs associated with producing the vehicle
Year:
 Calendar year
