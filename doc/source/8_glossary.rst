Glossary
--------

Action Alternative:
 A set of definitions that fully describe the OTAQ regulations under consideration
Age:
 Calendar year minus model year (age 0 = MY 2020 vehicles in CY 2020)
Analysis Context:
 The set of assumptions about the future within which the policies are evaluated. Note that all contexts must be internally consistent. Also known as 'Context'
Analysis Year:
 Any calendar year for which the model is generating results
Analysis Start Year:
    The first year for which the model is generating results.
Baseline Scenarios:
 This is also known as 'BAU' or 'Reference'. The term is too ambiguous without further clarification. See "Policy Alternatives" and "Context Scenarios" instead.
Base Model Year:
 The last model year of the historical fleet
Base Year:
 The last calendar year of the historical input data. Also known as 'Initial Year'
Candidate Vehicles:
 The set of vehicles, and their prices and attributes, sent from the Producer Module to the Consumer Module for consideration during the market share iteration between the two modules.
Consumer Generalized Cost:
 This is part of the Demo Analysis estimation of market shares, and comes from GCAM-USA. It includes capital costs (including candidate vehicle prices fed in from the Producer Module, and the cost of a home charger), fuel costs, maintenance costs, time cost of fueling, and parameter values for amortization period and discount rate
Context Policy:
 The vehicle emissions policy (or policies) that is inherent in the analysis context, and consistent with all other analysis context assumptions. This is the first policy alternative session that must be run in order to ensure that the modeled results are consistent with the analysis context.
Count:
 The number of vehicles registered at a given time. Also known as 'Population'
Credit:
 The currency of compliance as measured in Mg CO2 equivalent. In a fleet averaging program, it is determined by the difference between vehicle certified and target emissions aggregated across the producerâ€™s vehicles.
Effectiveness:
 Incremental percentage reduction in CO2 emissions between two packages
Generalized Cost:
 Sum of monetary and non-monetary costs of the choices considered by the decision maker. - valuation? What is non-monetary for producers?
Make:
 Consumer recognizable brand of a historical vehicle (e.g. "Chevrolet"). Also known as 'Brand'
Manufacturer:
 Company that is treated as a regulated entity (e.g. "General Motors")
Market Class:
 The categorization of vehicles used for projecting market shares and modeling consumer response to policy through shifts in market shares
Nameplate:
 Consumer recognizable name of historical vehicles (e.g. "Cruze"). Also known as 'Model'
No-action Policy Alternative:
 The policy alternative from which the effects of the action policy alternatives are measured
OMEGA:
 Optimization Model for reducing Emissions of Greenhouse Gasses from Automobiles
On-Road Gap:
 Difference between direct cert emissions and direct on-road emissions
Policy Alternatives:
 Encompasses both the No-action Alternative and the Action Alternatives. This is a more generic term than the alternatives. Also known as 'Policy Scenarios'
Produced Vehicles:
 The set of vehicles and their attributes that lead to convergence in the market share iteration between the Consumer Module and Producer Module. The set of produced vehicles is the final set of candidate vehicles passed from the Producer Module to the Consumer Module.
Producer Generalized Cost:
 The total of the monetary expenses of bringing a product to the consumer, and the value the producer expects can be recovered from consumers at the time of purchase
Regulatory Class:
 The categorization of vehicles defined by the Policy Alternative and considered in the producers' compliance decisions and not necessarily related to market class classification considered by the consumer
Reregistration:
 Measures the used vehicle stock, or the vehicles that have been kept in the fleet for onroad use, reregistered, each year
Scenario:
 This term is too ambiguous without further clarification - avoid using without clarification
Stock:
 The set of vehicles and their attributes registered at a given time
Technology Packages:
 A full set of vehicle design attributes that determine the emissions of an individual candidate vehicle. This includes the combined effects of component efficiencies, component sizing, vehicle weight and road loads on emissions rates over various operating modes (e.g. test cycles.) The technology package would not include attributes that are independent of emissions, such cabin interior features, entertainment system, colors, etc.
Vehicle Cost:
 The costs associated with producing a vehicle
Year:
 Calendar year unless otherwise stated
