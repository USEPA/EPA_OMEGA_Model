"""
**A set of base classes used to define the program interface(s) and to serve as templates for user-defined classes**

Ordinarily these classes might be implemented as Python abstract classes but abstract classes cause issues when
combined with SQLAlchemy base classes, so the implementation here is a workaround - if a child class fails to implement
one of the required methods, the class will throw a runtime Exception or return an error message.
