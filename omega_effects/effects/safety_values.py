**INPUT FILE FORMAT**

The file format consists of a one-row template header followed by a one-row data header and subsequent data
rows.

The data represent safety values associated with mass reduction in the fleet.

File Type
    comma-separated values (CSV)

Sample Header
    .. csv-table::

       input_template_name:,safety_values,input_template_version:,0.1

Sample Data Columns
    .. csv-table::
        :widths: auto

        body_style,nhtsa_safety_class,threshold_lbs,change_per_100_lbs_below_threshold,change_per_100_lbs_at_or_above_threshold
        sedan,PC,3201,0.012,0.0042
        pickup,LT/SUV,5014,0.0031,-0.0061
        cuv_suv,CUV/Minivan,3872,-0.0025,-0.0025

Data Column Name and Description
    :body_style:
        The OMEGA body_style (e.g., sedan, pickup, cuv_suv)

    :nhtsa_safety_class:
        The NHTSA safety class (e.g., PC, LT/SUV, CUV/Minivan)

    :threshold_lbs:
        The curb weight, in pounds, above and below which safety values may change.

    :change_per_100_lbs_below_threshold:
        A percentage change in the fatality rate associated with reductions in curb weight below the associated curb
        weight threshold; a positive value denotes an increase in fatality rate associated with a reduced curb weight
        while a negative value denotes a decrease in fatality rate associated with a reduced curb weight; increased
        curb weights would have the opposite effect on fatality rate.

    :change_per_100_lbs_at_or_above_threshold:
        A percentage change in the fatality rate associated with reductions in curb weight above the associated curb
        weight threshold; a positive value denotes an increase in fatality rate associated with a reduced curb weight
        while a negative value denotes a decrease in fatality rate associated with a reduced curb weight; increased
        curb weights would have the opposite effect on fatality rate.
