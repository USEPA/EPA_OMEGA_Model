**INPUT FILE FORMAT**

The file format consists of a one-row template header followed by a one-row data header and subsequent data
rows.

The data represents $/mile cost estimates associated with congestion and noise associated with road travel.

File Type
    comma-separated values (CSV)

Sample Header
    .. csv-table::

       input_template_name:,cost_factors_congestion_noise,input_template_version:,0.1

Sample Data Columns
    .. csv-table::
        :widths: auto

        reg_class_id,dollar_basis,congestion_cost_dollars_per_mile,noise_cost_dollars_per_mile
        car,2018,0.063390239,0.000940863
        truck,2018,0.056598428,0.000940863

Data Column Name and Description

    :reg_class_id:
        Vehicle regulatory class at the time of certification, e.g. 'car','truck'.  Reg class definitions may differ
        across years within the simulation based on policy changes. ``reg_class_id`` can be considered a 'historical'
        or 'legacy' reg class.

    :dollar_basis:
        The dollar basis of values within the table. Values are converted in-code to 'analysis_dollar_basis' using the
        implicit_price_deflators input file.

    :congestion_cost_dollars_per_mile:
        The cost per vehicle mile traveled associated with congestion.

    :noise_cost_dollars_per_mile:
        The cost per vehicle mile traveled associated with noise.
