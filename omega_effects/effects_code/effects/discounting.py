        discount_offset: A factor to address "start-of-year" or "end-of-year" cost accrual.

    Parameters:

        The passed dictionary with new key, value pairs where keys stipulate the discount rate and monetized values are discounted at their internally consistent discount rate.

    Note:
        Important input settings for discounting of monetized values are the "Discount Values to Year" and "Cost Accrual" settings.
        The year to which to discount monetized values is set by the "Discount Values to Year" entry of the input settings.
        The "Cost Accrual" input setting should be set to 'beginning-of-year' or 'end-of-year', where beginning-of-year represents costs
        accruing at time t=0 within the year, and end-of-year represents costs accruing at the end of the year.

        Values that occur prior to the "Discount Values to Year" input setting will not be discounted.
